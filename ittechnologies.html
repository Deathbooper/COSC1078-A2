	<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
  <p><b>What does it do?</b><br><br>Autonomous vehicles are self-piloted robots that use a multitude of sensors to navigate the area around them and often attempt to get to a specific location. They are not just simple implementations such as being able to drive within the lines or take a corner but are reactive to everything around them that a human would be too.<br><br>Autonomous vehicles are just beginning to see commercial use in the past couple of years or so and are looking to only get bigger. Although only a few companies are developing vehicles, or more so the sensors and other devices to completely navigate the vehicles through almost all kinds of roads and traffic. Autonomous cars have three primary sensors by default, camera, radar and lidar, along with other things to help steer the car such as GPS and some mechanism to steer the wheel. The camera sensor is self-explanatory, it sees and tries to comprehend the world as a human would, with sight, if it sees a person, it should recognise them and slow down if the system thinks that it may collide with the human. Radar is another of the primary sensors that shootout signals and wait for a return signal, the signal that they send is a microwave signal, unlike ultrasonic sensors or light sensors. The radar sensor is used to accurately gauge objects and their distance around the car. The final primary sensor is lidar, which uses lasers to do a very similar job to radar, it sends out a beam of light, a laser, and waits for a return of that light to accurately gauge objects and their distances, very similar to the radar sensors. All these sensors are sent to the system, along with other complimentary ones like the GPS, to be processed very quickly and direct the car to where it needs to be going.<br><br>Autonomy in vehicles is ranked in 6 levels, beginning with level 0 – no automation (self-explanatory), level 1 – hand on/shared control, this could be an automatic gearbox in an automatic car or assisted parking/steering. Level 2 – hands-off, this stage is where the driver does not need to input anything to the car but must stay vigilant as the car may still make a miscalculation and drive incorrectly. Level 3 – eyes off, this is the stage where the driver may let the car do all the work, but if the car begins to ask the driver for assistance, they must be ready to drive the car. Level 4 – mind off, this is the stage at which the driver essentially becomes the passenger, the car can do all the work and the occupant can do as they please in the car. Stage 5 - steering wheel optional, the car is most likely safer than a regular person driving, so it is optional to have a steering wheel for humans to control. On this scale, it is almost personal preference deciding which level is good enough to be called autonomous, on just level 2 the driver does not need to have any input, just to be ready if it is needed, and level 5 is of course fully autonomous as it requires and recommends no input. All these levels are available in the vehicle market from levels 0 – 5, being a manual car, automatic car or similar, vehicles like a Tesla, and for the top three a range of different commercial vehicles being offered for hire, like a taxi. This technology will only continue to expand its market, and I am sure that people can expect more developed and higher-level autonomy vehicles driving around in the next decade or so.</p>
  <p><b>What is the likely impact?</b><br><br>This technology will have a significant impact on how people travel and get to places in their everyday lives. Say that all vehicular travel were to be autonomous, and no person was to be controlling any of these vehicles, would this not have a drastic reduction in accidents and collisions, along with an increase in travel speed as every vehicle could communicate its position with one another and be able to predict the fastest routes and even be able to simultaneously go through intersections perpendicular to each other and not have any risk of collision as a result of complex calculations being made constantly. Should this be the case and autonomous vehicles reach this level, collisions would go down along with travel time and most likely the worry of people having to drive. The result of 100% autonomous cars will have an effect on jobs though, most likely making all taxis, limousine and other public transport job redundant, reducing the amount of jobs available as it doesn’t take 100 people to make well over 100 functioning autonomous vehicles. So, the total amount of jobs will decrease, with a massive reduction in jobs in transportation but a slight increase in engineers and the like for making the systems and cars that are autonomous. Some car fans will be disappointed by this change as often driving can be fun, and autonomous vehicles will take this away, so perhaps a middle ground can be found were non-autonomous vehicles and regular vehicles will be able to share the roads and allow those that want easy transportation what they want, and car fans are still able to drive and have what they want too.</p>
  <p><b>How will this affect you?</b><br><br>In my own daily life, I think that autonomous vehicle transportation would affect me quite the amount. Along with everyone else I believe. Most people are using cars as a main source of transportation in many different countries, with some outliers, but if they are simply wanting transportation then autonomous cars are most likely what they will use. Currently I do not often use my car as I am an 18 year old and buying fuel brings great sadness into my life for approximately 32 hours, so I opt to use trams and trains instead as they are readily available in Melbourne, the city in which I currently live. However, I myself am a car fan and do really enjoy driving, so I do find myself out late at night behind the wheel just driving to nowhere and returning home when either I feel the time is right or I feel the guilt of pointlessly wasting fuel. I believe that everywhere where autonomous cars are introduced the road safety will improve and the travel times will decrease, however, sometimes thought of crudely, (understandably), people do not always want what is best for them, and some people would prefer the freedom to be able to drive themselves to where they are going or to just have a bit of fun. I feel that most people though would be accepting of autonomous vehicles and would use them regularly, whether they be owned, leased or rented. Perhaps most of these vehicles would be electric, helping to reduce climate change via the reduction in vehicular pollution which would also be a great point of these autonomous vehicles, however for a diehard fan of a combustion engine, perhaps not so much. Overall the creation of autonomous vehicles would be an improvement to health and safety, a reduction in travel times and an improvement of mental health for those who do not enjoy driving, however all these things are double edged swords, with some people wanting the opposite whether it be good for them or not, but when have humans ever been driven completely by logic, we have emotions too you know?</p>

  <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
  <p><b>What does it do and how does it work?</b><br><br>Cybersecurity aims to protect systems, networks, and programs from digital attack through the implementation of effective cybersecurity measures. Digital attacks can consist of the viewing, altering and or destruction of sensitive information. These attacks can interrupt businesses processes and extort money from users (Cisco, 2022).<br><br>There are multiple types of cybersecurity threats that must be addressed. Phishing is the sending of fake emails that aim to trick the recipient into thinking that it is from a trusted source and thus leads to misplaced trust. This misplaced trust is then abused to steal sensitive information such as credit card numbers and login information. Ransomware infiltrates a computer system through phishing emails with malicious attachments or downloading infected files from a malicious website. It then extorts the user by preventing access to files on the computer system until a ransom is paid and even after paying such a ransom the files may or may not be returned (Cisco, 2022). Malware is software that aim to destroy or damage a computer or computer system (Cisco, 2022). Social engineering aims to deceive the user to get them to provide sensitive information. They may pretend to from a reputable company or make threats to get the user to provide information such as login details or for them to provide a monetary payment.<br><br>To protect from such attacks, multiple layers of protection must be spread among the computers, networks and, programs or data that the individual or organization seeks to keep safe (Cisco, 2022). On the user side protection consists of the basic data security principles such as choosing strong passwords, not opening unknown email attachments, and backing up their data (Cisco, 2022). In terms of technology, it is important to protect endpoint devices such as computers, smart devices along with routers, networks, and the cloud (Cisco, 2022). The most common technology for their protection includes firewalls, DNS (Domain Name System) filtering, anti-malware, anti-virus, and email checking solutions. Firewalls monitor outgoing and incoming traffic and allows or prevents the transfer data packets based on a set of security rules (Force Point, 2021). DNS filtering blocks access to certain sites of a particular category or type that are considered a threat. The DNS filter then blocks the IP address of these sites. These helps limit the amount of a threats a network is exposed to (Webroot, 2022). Malware helps to protect systems from malicious software. To do this it uses signature-based detection, behaviour-based detection, and sandboxing. Signature-based uses a set of established software components and digital signature commonly associated with malware. Behaviour-based looks at how the software acts within a system, if it is suspicious, it will be detected by the anti-malware. Sandboxing runs a suspicious file outside the system such as in a virtual environment with restricted access therefore if the file tries to access other files it will be blocked (Rosencrance, L., 2021). Anti-virus is also like anti-malware in that it checks computer programs and files against known malware. It uses specific detection for known malware, generic detection for known parts of malware and heuristic detection for suspicious file structures (Verizon Fios, 2022).</p>
  <p><b>What is the state of art of this new technology?</b><br><br>Due to the emergence of pro-active threat detection and prevention, heuristic-based and behaviour-based detection and prevention systems are currently considered the most advanced form of threat detection. NGAVs or “next generation antiviruses” implement such measures to counter threats unlike older AVs which mainly use signature-based detection which can only respond to recognized threats. This technology can not only block malware, but also malware-less attacks despite any tactics, techniques and procedures attackers decide to pull (Crowdstrike, 2021).</p>
  <p><b>What can be done now?</b><br><br>The state-of-the-art antivirus technology (NGAV) uses artificial intelligence along with behavioural detection, machine learning algorithms and exploit mitigation. This helps ensure that known and unknown threats can be predicted and thus prevented (Crowdstrike, 2021). Using machine learning algorithms NGAVs can perform signature-less malware protection which can determine whether a file might be malicious through recognizing typical malicious code and behaviour (Crowdstrike, 2021). Exploit mitigation helps to detect and prevent any program code that takes advantage of any vulnerabilities on the computer or computer system to gain unauthorised access or to perform malicious activities. Currently NGAVs are cloud-native which allow them to be fully operational in seconds with little to no setup (Crowdstrike, 2021).</p>
  <p><b>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</b><br><br>Likely most legacy antiviruses would be replaced by next-generation antiviruses and NGAVs would become more common. In the next three years NGAV likely will not only continue to get better at blocking malware but also be intelligent enough to stop most to all less indirect approaches to attacks such as fileless malware which does not rely on files but rather on exploits and other techniques.</p>
  <p><b>What technological or other developments make this possible?</b><br><br>The continual development of Artificial intelligence such as machine learning would help to boost the ability of NGAVs to find and prevent threats. As machine learning algorithms collect more historical data, it can use this for a basis to become increasingly sophisticated and intelligent thus allowing them to be more accurate and sensitive in predicting threats.</p>
  <p><b>What is the likely impact?</b><br><br>The potential impact of this development would be that due to the improvement of NGAVs in threat detection and prevention, it would be more difficult for attackers to infiltrate a computer network or system as the protection would be far more robust due to the more sophisticated and advanced machine learning algorithms which would prevent most to all malicious attacks.<br><br>This is especially important for businesses and companies who store sensitive information of their own employees plus any information they collect from their customers. A secure system is very important in preventing cyberattacks and maintaining customer trust. Due to NGAVs being cloud-native it allows a faster deployment as it is nowhere near as cumbersome as a Legacy AV which usually requires that hardware be installed at the physical premises which can take on “average 3 months” (Crowdstrike, 2021). As a result, Businesses and companies would be more likely to switch to NGAVs for their threat protection if they have not already after the improvements to NGAVs. As more companies and businesses switch to NGAVs the overall safety and protection of companies and businesses as a whole would increase therefore creating a safer environment for customers and individuals who can then feel more secure when providing their personal information to companies/businesses.<br><br>As more benefits of NGAVs become known, their popularity would increase, and thus the use of NGAVs would extend beyond companies and businesses but also the wider community and people would start to use NGAVs in place of their traditional legacy antiviruses. Though people who are not too concerned with their own cybersecurity who may not use or care about any protection would be unlikely to be affected by the further development of NGAVs. Legacy antiviruses would become redundant, and the use of them would fade into obscurity as Legacy AV as an approach is “becoming obsolete” (Crowdstrike, 2021) as attackers become more sophisticated.</p>
  <p><b>How will this affect you?</b><br><br>If next generation antiviruses improve significantly over the next three years, in terms of my experience with my personal computer it would have little to no effect on the overall security of my system. As I am a personally not too concerned about the security of my system, I would not change my current antivirus protection (windows defender) to a next generation antivirus such as Crowdstrike. If Microsoft decides to update their windows defender to become a next generation antivirus, then it would affect my everyday life as the protection of my system would be stronger and would prevent and protect against more threats. In terms of my experience with the companies and organizations that I interact with such as CommBank, if they were to implement these next generation antiviruses into their computer systems it would help to ensure that my personal and sensitive information such as card numbers and security codes is protected from potential cyberattacks which may aim to steal such information from the bank. With the added security of next generation antiviruses for organisations it would be less likely for them to have their services shut down by cyberattacks which would improve the user experience and availability for the services that I use such as Centrelink or myGov.<br><br>For my family and friends, they would also be affected in the same way in that if next generation antiviruses become more popular and widely used by organisations and companies it would improve the security of their personal and sensitive information that is stored in the companies that they interact with. It would also reduce the frequency of shutdowns for the services that they use due to cyberattacks thus increasing availability. Depending on which family members and friends they may or may not install NGAV software into their personal computers. For those that do install an improved NGAV it would significantly increase the security of their personal computers and would ensure that their files and documents in their computers are safe from cyberattacks.</p>

  <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
  <p><b>What does it do and how does it work?</b><br><br>Machine learning is a subset of Artificial intelligence that focus on mass data processing to identify or predict the future trend. (IBM Cloud Education, 2020) By parsing massive dataset, machine can learn, identify data for automation, these included but not limit to: music identification and content recommendation. (Grieve, 2020) Machine learning can be supervised, which human telling machine the knowledge (for example image identification) (Russell & Norvig, 2020, p. 653) or finding the pattern on its own with unsupervised learning. (Grieve, 2020)<br><br>Neural network, akin to neuron cells in our brain, are clusters of "nodes" interconnect to each other, each node has a threshold for data characteristic with "weight" to redirect to the next layer, this process will repeat itself until it reaches the output layer, the machine then decide what the input is based on the weight of each possible outcome. (Nicholson, 2020) The basic algorithm used by neural network is Q-learning with update equation <br><br>Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[R(s,a,s') + γ max Q(s',a') − Q(s,a)]. Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + 𝛼[R(s,a,s′) + 𝛾 max Q(s′,a′) − Q(s,a)].<br><br>The basic principle is we first randomize the weight of all nodes, for each state (s) with all possible actions (a) we take the maximum value, and we adjust the weight for each action (nodes) accordingly, the amount of adjustment is determined by learning rate α.<br><br>[Equation][Equation](Russell & Norvig, 2020, pp. 797-805)[Equation]</p>
  <p><b>What is the state of art of this new technology?</b><br><br>Companies like Google and NVidia have been experimenting self-driving car since 2015, through neural network and reinforce learning, the system can identify what it sees in camera and steering vehicle. The computation is immense as not only it has to take in camera footage and identify the environment (roads, traffic light, pedestrians, etc), the processor then predict the best outcome for all action. Millions of matrix multiplications are done in every second   (Ni, et al., 2020) </p>
  <p><b>What can be done now?</b><br><br>Training machine with customer's financial activity log, banking institution can monitor unusual behaviour that potentially fraudulent and account freezing (Soni, 2019)<br><br>Deep Learning Super-Sampling is a technology developed by NVidia, by ingesting massive dataset of high-res real-life footage, they build up a neural model that runs on tensor cores included in RTX series graphic cards. The Neural network can take low-res rendering and conjure millions more pixels out of thin air without looking blurry. (Nvidia, 2022)</p>
  <p><b>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</b><br><br>Since 1980s, digital started replacing analogue as the preferred data type for compute and storage, they are precise, resist to corruption, and easy to program. Unlike traditional workload, AI don't need these traits, there is no need to calculate weight in extreme precession and the processor does only one kind of calculation, and machine spend most of it time storing and retrieving model. Analog processor however changed everything. It can compute data to much faster, storing model on chip and produced the same result with much lower wattage.<br><br>(Mythic, 2022) </p>
  <p><b>What technological or other developments make this possible?</b><br><br>At the start of AI research scientists were using CPU for computation, Krizhevsky, et al. (2012) demonstrated the power of parallel computing on GPU (GTX 580 contains 32 streaming processor (NVidia, 2010) while high end CPUs at that time have 4 cores 8 threads at most), this discovery kick start a new dawn of AI racing.</p>
  <p><b>What is the likely impact?</b><br><br>One of these other uses could be, in simple terms, optimization. Think of things like large pieces of code, that are hard to digest for almost anybody, however a machine can read it fine, and if it can be taught to make the program better via checking millions of different combinations and functions, it will be able to successfully optimize the program, perhaps with greater efficiency or effectiveness than a programmer would be able to, this may not currently be the case, however machine learning will only be improving and it may eventually reach this level. Things like the travelling salesman problem can be optimized by incorporating machine learning to help find the most efficient routes, the applications for machine learning in the optimization of many things is possible, it just must be properly introduced and produced so it is easier to use for the masses.<br><br>Another of the many uses of machine learning is artificial intelligence, something that is a hot topic just by itself some with it and some against it, perhaps influenced by media such as movies or simply the news having a grim outlook on the future of AI, well those outlooks are interesting at least. Machine learning can be used to teach the AI, things like neural networks are intimately connected to machine learning as they are the foundation of the processes that machine learning uses. Neural networks are like the thoughts that machine learning uses to create specific outcomes based on the inputs or stimulation that the system receives, this is important because it is essentially the same as a human learns, we create outcomes based on the way our brain interprets the information we are given, the parallels are clear to see. As AI can be a fantastic asset to humanity, and machine learning is extremely important to AI, machine learning is a fantastic asset to humanity, and it is going to have a significant impact on the future, likely for the good, only a small chance of a terminator situation.</p>
  <p><b>How will this affect you?</b><br><br>As an avid PC gamer one of my top concerns is my experience in video game, and the struggle of choosing between performance and quality. DLSS massively improving performance without sacrifice too much visual appeal. (Nvidia, 2022) Feature like this will be massively adopted by other GPU maker as 4K gaming and ray tracing make their way to mainstream gaming and I don't want my graphic card up fire because I wish to render a few more pixels.<br><br>For a more controversial aspect machine learning also powering facial recognition, the obviously issue is privacy. Like said if I had my photo on social media, this could connect to some sort of government database and these feds can use it to track me down with nothing but some blur surveillance footage, without even acquire court warrant. And none of these are new just look at China, they have everyone's face in their database, combine with millions of surveillance cameras they catch anyone from (Mozur, 2018).</p>

  <h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>
  <p><b>What does it do?</b><br><br>Natural language processing, or NLP, is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand human language, including nuances and intent within spoken or written text. Due to the irregularities contained within human language, such as homophones, idioms, metaphors, exceptions to grammar rules and sentence structure variations, it is quite a challenge to create programs that can accurately understand the intended meaning of text or voice data. To allow computers to make sense of all this, there are several NLP tasks that are performed to break down the data and make sense of it. These tasks include speech recognition, grammatical tagging, word sense disambiguation, named entity recognition, co-reference resolution, and sentiment analysis. Speech recognition is the task that converts spoken word into written text. This can be a challenging task due to the differences in how people speak, having to account for accents, talking quickly or with slurring, and incorrect grammar to name a few elements. Grammatical tagging is the way in which NLP determines the meaning of a part of speech based on its context and use. For example, the difference between bow as a noun and bow as a verb. Word sense disambiguation is how the meaning of a word is selected by analyzing its semantics and determining what meaning makes the most sense in that context. This is how NLP deals with homonyms and similar situations. Named entity recognition is simply used to identify words as important entities, such as places or names. Similarly, co-reference resolution is how NLP determines when two words refer to the same entity, commonly this occurs with matching pronouns to entities but also with metaphors and idioms. Finally, sentiment analysis is when subjective qualities are extracted from the text, such as attitudes and emotions. These tasks make up the subsection of natural language processing called natural language understanding, which as the name implies, is concerned with the understanding of human language. The other subsection of NLP is natural language generation, which focuses on giving the computer the tools to generate its own text mimicking human language. Natural language generation used to simply use templates and fill them out with data but has since improved to be much more dynamic with the introduction of neural networks.<br><br>Initially, the first natural language processors were coded by hand and used a set of rules to perform limited tasks, but this approach was limited to smaller scales and struggled to keep up with ever increasing amounts of text or voice data. Since then, NLP has come to use a combination of algorithms and deep learning models to automatically analyze each element of given data and assign a statistical likelihood to the various possible meanings. Additionally, the use of deep learning models and techniques based on both convolutional and recurrent neural networks allows NLP to learn as it works to process and understand this data. As the AI behind NLP improves, it is thought that eventually NLP will become more proactive in its uses. As an example, if a user extensively uses a virtual agent to order food, the agent could begin to prompt the user when it thinks the ser will want to eat, or even recommend alternatives to the user. Similarly, in a business environment an NLP could analyze the data from employee emails and calls and make suggestions for email structures or alternative communication methods for the business that would be more cost efficient. This proactive NLP is beginning to be explored as neural network and AI technology improves, and the potential uses in both a personal and business environment are numerous.<br><br>There are several fields that natural language processing is already impacting, such as healthcare, education, finance, data science and business. This is due to the ability of NLP to process a large amount of data quickly and accurately. For example, in the healthcare industry NLP can be used to draw conclusions from patient data about symptom patterns and patient behavior. Additionally, the elements of natural language understanding can be used to assist in research with mental health and understand the emotions and feelings of patients. Another relevant example would be in education, where NLP is used to detect plagiarism and grammar quickly. Not just assisting teachers, students can also make use of NLP, for assistance with writing or to better research with data mining and summarization. These are just some of the fields that NLP is already making an impact. These uses will only improve with time as the technology behind natural language processing gets better.</p>
  <p><b>What is the likely impact?</b><br><br>When it comes to the future impact on jobs or technologies, there will certainly be changes caused by this technology, but it is unlikely to fully replace any current jobs. The current thoughts around NLP and its uses are that it works best when used in conjunction with a human element. Natural language processing will certainly automate some tasks, or at the very least make them significantly quicker, but this is in conjunction with human input. This will allow for much higher productivity and faster turnaround times for tasks, and a change in how many jobs are performed. These changes will affect many professional sectors, by not only improving the speed of their work but also potentially the quality. As NLP improves and gets better at tasks like summarization and data mining, various professional roles will be able to make use of this to, for example, rapidly increase the speed that research and analysis can be done.</p>
  <p><b>How will this affect you?</b><br><br>The main impact on me personally will be the use of virtual agents in my daily life. I am losing my vision over time so once I am visually impaired the use of virtual agents will play a significant role in keeping everything running smoothly in my day-to-day operations. For example, phone and computer operation will be difficult with a touchscreen and keyboard, so the use of virtual agents will be key in their use, whether it be for work or entertainment purposes.<br><br>As for the impact NLP will have on my friends and family, I would think that it would be like the impact on the rest of the population. In work environments certain jobs and tasks will become easier to a point of automation, and this will allow them to be much more productive. The only caveat will be those that work in medical fields, as I think the technology will have to be exceptionally reliable to see frequent use there, especially when handling important data. I think that NLP will certainly improve elements of daily life though, as it already has. As an example, improvements in machine translation have allowed us to more easily understand (somewhat) other languages, and spam detection makes use of NLP to keep our email inboxes free from spam email, and these will only get better over time.</p>
