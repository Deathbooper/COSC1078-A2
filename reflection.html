	<h2>Individual Reflections</h2>
  <p><b>Adrian:</b><br><br>In terms of what went well with regards to assignment 2 would be that for the final week of the assignment 2 the communication between team members was good for the most part. Once tasks were properly delegated between team members there was a spike in productivity for most team members. One thing that could be improved for completing assignments would be that for the beginning weeks, the productivity was incredibly low (shown by empty team's documents) as the due date was “far away” and therefore not much was done for the first two weeks. This led to some crunching towards the due date of the assignment. This could be improved by starting to get into assignments earlier. Another thing that would be improved would be to delegate definite tasks to team members initially as at the beginning only some team members had vague idea of what to do and therefore did not have a goal. One thing that was surprising was that it is harder to delegate tasks the more team members there are. One thing that I have learnt about groups would be the importance of communication. It is very frustrating when team members take a significant amount of time to respond to a message or not respond at all or fails to inform me of their lack of ability to complete a task.</p>
  <p><b>Heath:</b><br><br>The majority of our group worked well, and I had a good time working with them. Everything progressed smoothly with a little bit of a motivation boost toward the end with the due date quickly approaching, but that is to be expected, especially with all the other assignments that we had due at the start of this assignment. The meetings went well and were all attended competently, minus a few people every now and again. The delegation of work was fairly distributed between all group members considering all of our skills and availabilities, although sometimes there was a push required for some members to do the work as they may have been struggling or just lazy, so other members would have to go and help them out, even though they had already done their assigned work, adding even more work to what they had already done, contributing to an uneven work distribution. Our group had good communication throughout the assignment when people had questions and the environment was a supportive one, I don’t think anyone was afraid to ask for help, of course there were a few communication mishaps and what not but that is to be expected when dealing with a multiple weeklong assignment. If I were to give criticisms, it would be that the lower performing group members just need to bite the bullet and get to work.</p>
  <p><b>Lachlan:</b><br><br>Overall, I found that our group worked well together with this assessment, but there's a couple of issues that need to be ironed out. Meeting attendance and overall work contribution was mostly good, although a bit of prodding was occasionally needed to keep things moving on time, and one team member came to almost no meetings. Our early productivity needs to be improved with the next assessment, as we didn't really kick into gear until the end of the Easter break, though having two assessments due in the first week and then a mid-semester break didn't help motivations. Most of the group though was very active in completing work tasks and coming up with ideas, which the meetings will show. I found it surprising at how well we were able to get in gear and keep a steady workflow once we got into it, as previous groupwork I've done has normally suffered from having only a couple of members working while the rest do very little, so I'm quite pleased this wasn't the case here. I think it helps to have one or two people take on a leadership role, as once we had this in place things ran a lot smoother.</p>
  <p><b>Shiou-ping:</b><br><br>I would say most of us are very involved on this project at the end, although I'd admit that it took me way too long to figure out the structure of our assignment and what I have to do, and got quiet frustrated when I first learned that I need to write another long form report, I'm glad that after some consultation with tutor and team member I managed to put myself together and complete the IT topic. One thing I didn't expect is I end up being the one facilitated the interview, even though other members provided the questions and transcription, I know what I've done is rather trivial but at least I got some additional chances to contribute the groupwork.<br>As others mention we only ramp up our production at the last few weeks despite all the meeting we had before, this kind of procrastination is indeed troubling giving the upcoming assignment will be bigger and even more report to write, we need to find some way to boost some team morale and ensure we won't be in the same pitfall again.<br>Also, one of our members went dark for extend amount of time which complicate the whole situation, I guess it's always important to have plan B.</p>
  <p><b>Henry:</b><br><br>In my opinion the group functioned efficiently despite some setbacks that were faced. Meeting attendance could have been better in terms of communication between group members for if they cannot make some meetings. The group worked well to finish answering questions to a considerable extent and helping other members with their questions.  Having a ‘chaser’(undone work follow up) in the group really benefited the work being done as they acted to remind members of undone work. There are many things that could be improved in order to maximise group efficiency. Some problems were: little to no communication at times which led to higher amounts of stress. Work splitting, to improve the splitting of work it would work more efficiently to sort it out on the very first ‘meeting’. Personally, I was surprised by how quickly the word count went up when all members were working together on the documents.</p>
  <p><b>Ryan:</b><br><br>Overall, I would say our group functioned well, even though we were delayed towards the beginning of our assignment, due to other assignments, we still managed to get everything done. Our communication as a whole could have been improved, which I take blame for as for many of the meetings I wasn’t available at the given times, or I was sick with Covid. I felt my input wouldn’t have been helpful throughout the last few weeks as I wasn’t doing much Uni work due to my illness, as I had Covid then the ‘super flu’. However, I still did my best to participate through messaging on MS Teams and keeping up with what the group was doing. Something we did well was associating separate tasks to individual team members, everyone did what they were supposed to which is how our team competed this assignment. This was helpful as we couldn’t do much work together since we only met once a week through class. Alongside the group work, my job was to handle the interview, which I had prepped for early, including creating the interview questions and prepping the interviewee, an IT specialist. I contacted him several times and even met with him face-to-face as he requested so he could have a better idea of what we were trying to accomplish. Jerry was on-board, but it eventually didn’t work out as he was very busy with work, and we never managed to find a time that was fitting for the both of us.</p>

  <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
  <p>Overall, our group worked well together this assessment in the final week with good communication for most group members. Once tasks were properly delegated, the overall productivity of the group increased despite some members still forgetting to do their tasks. A element that could be improved would be the average productivity of the group over the entirety of the allocated assignment time. During the first week productivity was at an all-time low with mostly no work being completed during that week (evidenced by the empty teams document during that week). The second week was slightly better though some group members still did not do any work. Only towards the 3rd and 4th week of the assignment did most group members start working on the assignment. To improve this there should be more focus on delegating and completing tasks starting at the first week. Another element that could be improved would be attendance and communication. Meetings are very important for the group to communicate and therefore if a certain group member misses over 70% of the meetings it can lead to the group member not knowing what to do (evidenced by their lack of presence in meeting recordings). A way to improve this would be for this member to move around their schedule so that they are able to attend the meetings at the set days and times or if they are unable to attend then they should either watch the meeting recording or put a message in teams to ask about what they are supposed to be doing. Communication was bad regarding the interview and getting an interviewee as the group member responsible for getting the interview was supposed to have arranged one on the Monday of the final week but was unable to secure a time but did not communicate this with the other group member which led to unnecessary stress with finding another interviewee for the interview (evidenced by teams' messages). It was surprising that we were able to increase the group productivity so drastically between the 3rd and 4th weeks of the assignment once we had clear goals and tasks. One thing that we have learnt about groups would be the importance of having a group leader. The group needs a group leader to guide the other group members towards the same goal and right tasks. The group leader ensures that each group member knows what tasks they are responsible for doing and when they should have completed these tasks. Another thing that we have learnt about groups is the sheer importance of communication as when team members do not communicate if they have any problems with completing their tasks, the other group member would not know to help them which will lead to stress being placed on the other group members to help complete the task.</p>
