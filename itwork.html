  <h1>IT Work<h1>
	<h2>Interviewee Details</h2>
  <p>Adrian Bonetto, an IT auditor for ANZ.</p>

  <h2>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h2>
  <p>They started for five to six years as a software developer and IT architecture and around ten years doing IT audit/due diligence. As an auditor they audit the infrastructure or the application. An example of them auditing would be in a merge or acquisition such as two companies trying to merge, or one is trying to merge, or one is trying to buy the other one. They evaluate the IT state, how many applications exists, the end-of-life status of these applications and whether they are obsolete or not. They would be looking into the HR system because there would be redundancies once the company have merged. They evaluate the estate, and they do that by interviewing people and assessing the software source code. They use techniques or software that can help the evaluate the health of the source code. They also do audits to support the financial statements. Every year financial organisations or any organisations need to disclose their financial statement. There they need to engage with auditors to assess their financial position. Since that everything is done through technology, auditors need to ensure that the IT system supports the processes to generate these numbers and therefore need to be tested for completeness or accuracy so that the interface between the system is running smoothly so that a change of management, user access management and IT operations are being done correctly. They also look at the resiliency of the applications, whether they need testing.<br><br>Their main industry of work was more on the financial industry, more particularly the banking and capital markets. This industry includes corporate banking, wholesale banking and insurance and other different type of investments such as Super Fund and asset management. They mainly do work in retail banking.<br><br>More specifically as senior manager they oversaw setting up the project. They set up the timelines of when an audit's going to take place, engaging with the customer, looking at fees, time and resource requirements, the setting up teams. As a consultant manager they looked at the scope of the application that they're going to audit and then the type of procedures they need to execute. They may need to audit the change of management process, user access management process, security, data privacy, the infrastructure, the backup restoration and other things. Then they do interviews where they ask for evidence to analyse and look at exceptions. Then they use this to write a report to send to the customer for their feedback and recommendation regarding the actions that they are willing to take. Once that is over, they write a final report which is sent to the client.</p>

  <h2>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?</h2>
  <p>He interacted with a wide range of stakeholders, most of which he would refer to as customers, as if a business hired him, it was to do what they wanted him to do, just like if he were to freelance, except this one of course has a bit more job security. As he was a senior manager, he would create system developer teams, finding testers after developer testing has been completed dealings with the cloud and cybersecurity teams, dealing with sponsors and the project manager. Most of the time is spent in the system developer teams talking to the clients or customers, doing things like setting when the audits will take place, looking at the fees, setting up teams, addressing client questions, concerns or queries, sending letters of when work is starting and how it is progressing and writing reports on how the team is working together and how the work is going. As shown above the IT professional we interviewed was interacting with plenty of regular customers and the business alongside working with other IT professionals with various skillsets.</p>

  <h2>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h2>
  <p>Most of their time was spent auditing the infrastructure of the company that they were working for, many people were working on the infrastructure of the business, most of the time a banking business, and he would have to make sure that they had the correct information, things like the credibility of the sources that they were using and making sure that they complied to the cloud and security set out by the company. Finding the evidence was a time-consuming task as he would have to ask the people working on the infrastructure where they got their sources and other evidence and make sure that not only it was correct, but also to fix it if it was incorrect or to find the sources/evidence if they were missing. He would have to do this constantly while auditing the infrastructure.</p>

  <h2>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h2>
  <p>Once again it was finding evidence for the sources that the system developers had created. He would audit the infrastructure that the system development team was assigned to, and make sure that the infrastructure was correct and complied to the cloud and cybersecurity requirements. Good documentation really helped him in this aspect as if people were to document their sources, he would not need to find them and ask them to provide the correct evidence to support the sources that they were using in the infrastructure. This would take a long time, as an entire team of professional system developers were working on the infrastructure and he as senior manager and IT auditor would have to look through all the new work that they had been doing, and audit everything to make sure that it complied with all the policies and was sourced correctly, so if documentation was present to provide evidence for these sources, he would have a much easier time, unfortunately though, not everything was documented either at all or very well.</p>

  <h2>Example of their work that captures the essence of the IT industry.</h2>
  <p>Assessing the risks and challenges that come from people implement stuff, change stuff, develop new things, and have new ideas. One example he gave was the challenge of scalability, it may be simple to create just one simple program on a single computer, but when 10,000 people are working all in the one business and are all working on programs, sometimes collaboratively and sometimes not so much, so how does the business deal with the scalability of people implanting and changing stuff along with the introduction of new developments and ideas? He believes that this is the essence of IT work that he was dealing with.</p>
