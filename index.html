  <p><b>Group member 2: Heath Yates (s3942349) </b> </p>
  <p>Part two of the Clappers. I was born in Warrnambool and lived there until I was 18, I am still 18 but now I live in Melbourne so that I can study at RMIT. My ancestors were from Ireland and England but in recent history they are all Australian so therefore I am Australian too. Did years 12 twice, only speak English, used to play hockey and I am into cars. My interest in IT stems from wanting to make software that people will enjoy using. </p>
  <p><b>Group member 3: Lachlan Casey (s3721527)</b></p>
  <p>Born and raised here in Melbourne, I finished high school in 2017 and worked for a bit before coming to study at RMIT. My hobbies primarily revolve around the fantasy genre, whether that be with computer games or tabletop games. My interest in IT stems from when I built my first computer at 15, which then led to a general interest in technology and what it could do. My previous IT experience is mainly a VCE IT course, as well as a bit of hobby work with my friends and I’s computers. Currently working as part of the Clappers. </p>
  <p><b>Group member 4: Shiou-Ping Chu (s3734303) </b></p>
  <p>International student from Taiwan after some failed attempted in academic and came here for one last chance of redemption. Originally enrolled to software engineering, but unable to find an internship and failed on AI and computing theory, so I was cast down to Information technology. My goal is just finding a job in IT field and have a roof on my top, however fulfilling such vision while stay in Australia seems rather unlikely </p>
  <p><b>Group member 5: Henry Norman (s3953843) </b></p>
  <p>I grew up on a farm in rural Northeast Victoria near, Albury/Wodonga outside a town called Rutherglen. I am the youngest out of my siblings, I have two older brothers that are currently studying tertiary studies. I was born in Australia. I have a wide range of hobbies, some of which include Playing video games, shooting and 4x4ing, I also have a strong interest in most things to do with technology and computers. I love going shooting, specifically clay targets and biathlon, to which I held champion for several years. I also enjoy 4x4ing and hiking. My greatest hiking achievement and claim to fame was completing ‘The Overland track’ in a blizzard. During my studies through high school, I took up a casual job at Buller Wines to which I would often work holidays and some public holidays at, it was here where I picked up a strong work ethic. I chose an IT degree because I take a heavy interest in technology and want to learn application development, learn cybersecurity and pick up a degree that will help me into suitable jobs related to software development. I have no formal experience with IT only self-learned unity and Vex programming. </p>
