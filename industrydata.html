    <p> The demand of IT jobs has seen a significant increase over the years with Australia’s technology workface seeing an average trend growth of 2.5% per annum between 2011 and 2018 which is outpacing growth in the overall Australian labor market (ACS Deloitte Australia’s digital pulse 2019). With this Australia’s technology workforce is forecast to grow by 100,000 workers between 2018 and 2024 with the health care industry seeing the fastest technology workforce growth, at 7.3% per annum (ACS, 2019). In addition to this the ICT services exports went from $2.93b in 2016-17 to $3.78b in 2017-2018 which has led to the ICT services trade services increase from $170m to $515m. (ACS, 2019).<br><br>The past and predicted data all point to an increase in demand for IT based jobs and therefore as all the ideal jobs proposed by our group members are IT related, it is likely for them to see an increase in demand by the time we complete this information technology course. Therefore, this would reinforce their opinions on their ideal jobs as their future seems more certain.</p>

    <h2>Skill Rankings</h2>
    <p><b>General Skills:</b><br><br>In terms of ranking for demand there are some skills mentioned that do not appear in the burning glass technologies data and therefore cannot be ranked. Communication is rank 1 as of February 28, 2018, Problem solving is rank 2 as of February 28, 2018, Organizational Skills is rank 3 as of February 28, 2018, Writing is rank 4 as of February 28, 2018, Teamwork/Collaboration is rank 5 as of February 28, 2018, Troubleshooting is rank 6 as of February 28, 2018, Planning is rank 7 as of February 28, 2018, Detail-orientated is rank 8 as of February 28, 2018, Leadership is rank 11 as of February 28, 2018, Time management is rank 12 as of February 28, 2018, Quality Assurance and Control is rank 14 as of February 28, 2018, Analytical skills is rank 17 as of February 28, 2018, Management is rank 19 as of February 28, 2018, Multitasking is rank 20 as of February 28, 2018, Decision making is rank 25, Mentoring is rank 13 as of February 28, 2018, Meeting deadlines is rank 16 as of February 28, 2018, team building is rank 18 as of February 28, 2018.<br><br>The 8 highest in demand general skills such as Communication, Problem solving, Organization, Writing, Teamwork/collaboration, Troubleshooting, Planning and Detail-Orientated are all included in the group skill set. Though since that the most recent burning glass data provided is from February 28, 2018, it can be conceived that there may have been changes in the ranking of general skills though general skills seem to the most consistent with reference to the previous years.</p>
    <p><b>IT-Specific Skills:</b><br><br>In terms of ranking for demand there are multiple skills mentioned that do not appear in the burning glass technologies data and therefore cannot be ranked. Linux is rank 13 as of March 23, 2018, SQL is rank 1 as of March 23, 2018, Microsoft windows is rank 4 as of March 23, 2018, Technical support is rank 11 as of March 23, 2018, JavaScript is rank 2 as of March 23, 2018, JAVA is rank 3 as of March 23, 2018, Project Management is rank 5 as of March 23, 2018, Building relationships is rank 8 as of March 23, 2018, Customer service is rank 14 as of March 23, 2018, Software engineering is rank 15 as of March 23, 2018, .NET programming is rank 16 as of March 23, 2018, Python is rank 22 as of March 23, 2018, Systems engineering is rank 24 as of March 23, 2018, ITIL Framework is rank 20 as of March 23, 2018, Microsoft office 365 is rank 18 as of March 23, 2018, Website production is rank 17 as of March 23, 2018. Git is rank 21 as of March 23, 2018.<br><br>The 5 highest in demand IT-specific skills such as SQL, JavaScript, JAVA, Microsoft Windows are all included in the group skill set. Though since that the most recent burning glass data provided is from March 23, 2018, there may have been changes in the ranking of IT-specific skills as previous data has had some significant changes in ranking with some skills even disappearing from the leaderboard.</p>
    <p><b>Skills Outside Group’s Requirements:</b><br><br>Creativity at rank 9, Research at rank 10 and presentation skills at rank 15 are all general skills that are not in our group’s required skill set.<br><br>SAP at rank 6, Business management at rank 7 and Business analysis at rank 9 are all IT-specific skills that are not in our group’s required skill set.</p>

    <h2>Job Opinions</h2>
    <p><b>Adrian:</b><br><br> Having looked at the data my opinion of what I deem to be my ideal job has not changed. Looking at the data regarding the ranking of jobs in terms of number of listings I can determine that the demand for my job is increasing by the year with being rank 22 in May 2017 to rank 8 by March 2018. This has given me greater confidence in the availability of similar jobs by the time I complete my Bachelor of Information Technology degree. In terms of skills, it’s only natural in a job about system administration, engineering and general IT support for there to be a requirement for communication and this also happens to the skill with the highest demand being rank 1 consistently. Second to this dealing with any issues that may arise from the system or individuals, problem solving are also very important skill which is supported by it being ranked 2 consistently in the burning glass data. As these skills are a given seeing them being placed at such as high rank on the burning glass data has not affected my judgement on the ideal job in any way.</p>
    <p><b>Heath:</b><br><br> Having looked at the data, my opinion of my ideal job has not changed all too much, some may be surprised that there is as much demand for customer service and relationship building in a job about software development as there is, however one must remember that they are creating the software for a client, someone that is paying you to make something that only they know about, so being able to talk and communicate with them is essential to creating software that they find satisfactory. As I have known this for a while now, it did not change my opinion of my ideal job, everything else the burning glass data gave was already fairly widely known.</p>
    <p><b>Lachlan:</b><br><br> After looking at data about my ideal job, my opinion on the job has improved somewhat as I hadn’t expected it to be ranked as high as it was, though this was a ranking for service desk analyst in general, not specifically team leads. The skills required for the role, especially the general skills, were ranked as I had expected them to be, as interpersonal skills as well as problem solving skills are always going to be in demand. This is doubly so when looking at a leadership position, as these general skills are key when managing a team. The IT skills are also not outside expectations for the role, especially the skills of project management and Microsoft Windows being ranked highly. So, whilst the skill rankings are no great surprise to me, the job itself being ranked as high as it was was not within my expectations, so my opinion has certainly improved on the position.</p>
    <p><b>Shiou-Ping:</b><br><br> The comparison between Ideal job and top IT-skills falls in line within my expectation. For most of the software developing position the ability to program and deploy with SQL Database and cross platform language like Java are highly sought after. Web based programming like JavaScript and html also lied in prominent spots although I'd assume it's due to the low bar of entry and employers expect a competent software engineer knows how to code in JavaScript. As for generic "soft" skill communication is obviously important since in a team-based workload able to communicate with co-worker is crucial for project to succeed. However, writing occupied the second most important skill does surprise me, as I long assumed that the job of programming is writing code and not report or essay (unless it's a more scientific position like AI research), but writing might also refer to project documentation and code annotation. Overall, my opinion stays as the same.</p>
    <p><b>Henry:</b><br><br> Upon looking over the data, my opinion on my ideal job has not changed a whole deal, It has infact enlightened me to what the most important aspects to the job actually are. Communication and teamwork is one of the highest-ranking skills, I didn’t find this too suprising because it is one of the most important aspects to a job. The software engineering is surprisingly low on the scale coming at rank 15 but in my personal opinion it interests me a lot, and no matter how it ranks I will still want to peruse it. It has become very clear that employers are after employees that are very strong in communication skills, organizational skills and problem solving. These aren't too surprising because they are critical thinking skills. The ranking of leadership was surprising to me as it ranks lower than I thought it would have been.  The burning glass data has broadened my understanding to what my job would entail.</p>
    <p><b>Ryan:</b><br><br> After discovering the burning glass data, my opinion of my Ideal Job has changed. My desire to do this job has not changed but the idea in my mind of the popularity of the job has changed. Most of the IT Specialist I know personally work in the Security field, so I assumed that it was a job with large numbers of employees, however according to this data, that is simply not the case. The ranks for security roles are at least in the bottom 20-30 rank of top jobs for those respective years. I thought this rank would be much higher, however this data is from 2017-2018 and currently it is 2022. I do know that the IT Security field is growing as new and improved technology that needs to be protected is being created every day, and a lot can change in 5 years when it comes to technology. So, I feel that this data is a little bit out-dated, and I will be looking for an IT Security job after a minimum of three years, once I have completed my tertiary education. I feel as if I do have many of the general skills required for this job as attained from my previous working experiences in team environments, however many of IT-specific skills and certifications still need to be achieved or learnt.</p>
